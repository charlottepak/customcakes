# Custom Cakes


This app allows a customer to log in to their account, customize their ice cream cake and add it to their order.

I was inspired by my dads ice cream shop. He recently took over the shop and is constantly being hit with challenges and roadblocks as a new small business owner. I helped out the best I could while working for him but by taking this course I had to retire from working with him and the store. I decided to build this app because the ice cream store has recently starting making a selling ice cream cakes. We have signiture cakes that we sell but my dad wants to sell cusomisable cakes as well. I thought that I would build this app to show him that he's always on my mind and that hopefully someday I'll be able to help him with his store again --just in a much different way.
